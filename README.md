# monty hall problem simulation cpp
A simple C++ program that simulates the classic Monty Hall problem. The program randomly assigns the prize behind one of the three doors, allows the player to pick a door, reveals a goat behind an unchosen door, and gives the option to switch. This project helped me understand probability, randomness, and basic control flow in C++.
